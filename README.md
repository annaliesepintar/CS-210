#8-1 Journal: Portfolio Submission

#Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
Project 3 is a program that analyzes text record of a grocery store. The records the program analyzes is a list of items purchased. As the list of items is read in, the amount of each item purchased it recorded. The program also displays a menu that gives the user the options to see a display a list of purchased items with the amount purchased, search for a specific item displaying the amount that item was purchased, display a histogram of item sales, or exit the program.

#What did you do particularly well?
I feel like the user interface I created with text output was pretty efficient. It was simple, clear what the program needed from the user and it did not clutter the screen. 

#Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
If I were to go back and change anything, I would redo a lot of the code written in Python. I am not as familiar with Python and I definitely took the easy way out and wrote the Python portion of the project as I would in any other language without exploring the libraries I had available. I think by doing that, my code would have been shorter and made more sense for a program that should be scalable. I read the file line by line instead of reading the entire file which I believe I could have done if I utilized the regular expressions module. Also, I would write another function for clearing the and displaying the new output. I had the same bit of code sprinkled around in my menu interaction function which cluttered the function and risked things being changed that didn't need to be. By making a clearing screen and displaying new output function, I could make sure that part of the code isn't affected if I were to go back and make changes.

#Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
The entire Python portion of the program was initially a challange because I had to keep familiarizing myself with basic syntax. I overcame this by reading. I went through zybooks and also googled things I didn't know and did my best to read in as much depth as I had time for to build my understanding of Python. I will definitely be using th site shared in announcemnets for testing Python code again.

#What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
Utilizing multiple languanges is definitely going to be transferable to other projects, even personal projects. I already have an idea for a practice project to utilize Python and C++ (get more practice with Python in general). I want to write a program where I enter the nutrition facts of foods I eat frequently and set the daily range of certain nutrients and have the program display daily meal plans that are within the range of nutrients. Similar to project 3, user interface and error checking could be done in C++ while data handling will be done in Pyon. 

#How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I made the program maintainable, readable and adaptable by writting seperate functions for the different tasks and sub tasks the project performed. Also, I utilized whitespace and made sure to include comments that made it clear what was going on in the program.
